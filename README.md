## About
This was created as part of a teste assignment. The application was created following a notion design with some information and guidelines that were obligatory to follow. The application was also created using pure php using OOP principles and MySQL database. It consists in 2 pages. The first one shows the data from database (if it has) and also has a checkbox so user can select and delete selected data. It also has a "ADD" button to take the user to the second page. This one has all the inputs so user can type the data and a "Save" as submit. It also has a Cancel that leads backs to the first page and all inputs have validation.

## How to install
After download the files you need to make sure to place the application files and folders in your preferreble localhost server (I use XAMPP). Be aware of the modifications you need to do on "Database.php" to match your own localhost database and your own table.
